Why Do We Need SIFT?
In real-world images:
Objects appear at different sizes
Objects may rotate
Illumination conditions vary
Problem:Pixel-based comparison fails.
Solution:Extract stable, local features.

What is SIFT?
SIFT is a feature extraction algorithm that:
Detects distinctive local keypoints
Describes them using robust descriptors
Is invariant to scale and rotation
Output:
Keypoints (location, scale, orientation)
128-dimensional descriptors

Scale-Space: Concept
Objects appear at different sizes due to distance.
Idea:Detect features at multiple scales so size changes do not affect
detection.

Scale-Space: Mathematical Formulation
L(x,y, σ) =G(x,y, σ)∗I(x,y)
Where:
I(x,y) – input image
G(x,y, σ) – Gaussian filter
σ– scale parameter
