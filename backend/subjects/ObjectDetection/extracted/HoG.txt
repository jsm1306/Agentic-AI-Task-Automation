What is HOG?
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)is a feature descriptor that:
Focuses onedge directions
Encodeslocal shape information
Is robust toillumination changes
Key Idea:Object appearance is well characterized by the distribution of
local intensity gradients.

Why Gradients Instead of Pixels?
Pixel values change with lighting
Gradients capturechanges, not absolute values
Edges define object shape
Edges⇒Shape⇒Object Identity

Step 1: Gradient Computation
For image intensityI(x,y):
Gx =I(x+ 1,y)−I(x−1,y)
Gy =I(x,y+ 1)−I(x,y−1)
Gx: horizontal edge strength
Gy : vertical edge strength
