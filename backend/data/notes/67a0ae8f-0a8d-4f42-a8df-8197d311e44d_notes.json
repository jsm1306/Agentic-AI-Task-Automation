Definition\nObject detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. It draws bounding boxes around detected objects and assigns a class label to each.\n\n### 2. Historical Context\n*   **Early Methods (Pre-Deep Learning):**\n    *   **Viola-Jones Detector (2001):** One of the first real-time object detection frameworks, primarily used for face detection. It utilized Haar features and AdaBoost for classification.\n    *   **HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients):** Used for object detection, particularly pedestrian detection, by describing the local appearance and shape of objects. Often combined with SVMs for classification.\n\n### 3. Deep Learning Revolution\nThe advent of deep learning significantly boosted the accuracy and speed of object detection.\n*   **Two-Stage Detectors (Region Proposal-based):** These methods first propose regions of interest (ROIs) and then classify and refine bounding boxes within those regions.\n    *   **R-CNN (Regions with CNN features - 2014):** Proposed using selective search to generate region proposals, then resizing these proposals and feeding them into a CNN for feature extraction, followed by an SVM for classification and a regressor for bounding box refinement. Computationally expensive due to redundant CNN computations.\n    *   **Fast R-CNN (2015):** Improved R-CNN by feeding the entire image into a CNN once to generate a feature map. Region of Interests (ROIs) are then projected onto the feature map, and a RoI Pooling layer extracts fixed-size features for each ROI. These features are then fed into a shared fully connected layer for classification (softmax) and bounding box regression.\n    *   **Faster R-CNN (2015):** Further improved Fast R-CNN by replacing selective search with a Region Proposal Network (RPN). The RPN shares convolutional features with the detection network, making the entire process end-to-end and significantly faster.\n\n*   **One-Stage Detectors (Single Shot):** These methods predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the full image in a single pass, making them faster but sometimes less accurate than two-stage detectors.\n    *   **YOLO (You Only Look Once - 2016):** Divides the image into a grid and each grid cell is responsible for predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities if the center of an object falls into that cell. Known for its speed.\n    *   **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector - 2016):** Uses a single neural network to predict multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. It employs multi-scale feature maps to detect objects of various sizes.\n\n### 4. Common Datasets\n*   **PASCAL VOC (Visual Object Classes):** A benchmark dataset for object detection, segmentation, and classification, containing 20 object classes.\n*   **COCO (Common Objects in Context):** A large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset with 80 object categories, known for its challenging images and diverse contexts.\n\n### 5. Evaluation Metrics\n*   **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. A threshold (e.g., 0.5) is typically used to determine if a detection is correct.\n*   **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** The primary metric for object detection. It is the average of Average Precision (AP) across all object classes. AP itself is the area under the Precision-Recall curve.\n\n### 6. Challenges\n*   **Scale Variation:** Detecting objects of very different sizes.\n*   **Occlusion:** Objects partially hidden by other objects.\n*   **Clutter:** Objects in densely packed scenes.\n*   **Viewpoint Variation:** Objects appearing from different angles.\n*   **Illumination Changes:** Variations in lighting conditions.\n*   **Small Objects:** Detecting tiny objects can be particularly challenging for some models.",
