This method can distinguish CO2 from other gases and atmospheric components.\n    *   **Thermal Cameras (Infrared Thermography):** CO2 has distinct absorption and emission spectra in the infrared range. Thermal cameras can detect variations in temperature caused by CO2 plumes, especially when there's a temperature difference between the CO2 and the ambient air. This is particularly useful for detecting leaks.\n    *   **Gas Sensors:** Direct measurement of CO2 concentration using electrochemical, NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared), or photoacoustic sensors. While not strictly 'object detection' in the visual sense, arrays of these sensors can be used to map and infer the presence of CO2 'objects' or plumes.\n\n2.  **Applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning:**\n    *   **Image Processing:** Techniques applied to hyperspectral or thermal images to enhance CO2 features, reduce noise, and segment CO2 plumes.\n    *   **Spectral Analysis:** Algorithms to analyze the spectral signatures from hyperspectral data to quantify CO2 concentrations and identify its presence.\n    *   **Neural Network Architectures (e.g., CNNs):** Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks, are employed for:\n        *   **Object Detection:** Identifying and localizing CO2 plumes within images or video streams (e.g., using models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN adapted for CO2 signatures).\n        *   **Classification:** Differentiating CO2 plumes from other gases or environmental factors.\n        *   **Quantification:** Estimating the concentration or flow rate of CO2 based on visual characteristics.\n\n3.  **Key Challenges:**\n    *   **Environmental Factors:** Atmospheric conditions (humidity, temperature, other gases) can interfere with detection.\n    *   **Background Clutter:** Distinguishing CO2 from natural background variations can be difficult.\n    *   **Data Availability:** Labeled datasets for training deep learning models are often scarce.\n    *   **Real-time Processing:** The need for rapid detection and response, especially in leak scenarios.\n\n4.  **Industrial Applications:**\n    *   Monitoring CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities.\n    *   Detecting leaks in CO2 pipelines and storage sites (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage - CCUS).\n    *   Environmental monitoring and atmospheric research.",
